### Scenario

The EPA is interested in the possible benefits or disadvantages in Electric vs. Traditional Combustion Vehicles. They want to know about CO2 emissions and Fuel Efficiency between different manufacturers in order to implement stricter regulations and incentivise the production of eviormentaly friendly vehicles. Consumers are also interested in which vehicles are in their best interest (fuel efficient) when inquiring about different vehicle types and manufacturers. Your team wants to find insights for your stakeholders inorder to aid in the reduction of green house gas emissions and increased fuel efficiency. 

## 1. Ask

:flashlight: **Business Task: Analyze EPA Dataset to discover insights about Electric vs. Traditional Vehicles GHG Emissions and Fuel Efficiency**

Primary Stakeholders: 

Enviromental Protection Agency (EPA): Organization Responsible for monitoring and regulating vehicle emissions, the EPA has a vested interest in understanding the enviormental impact of electric and traditional vehicles on GHG emissions.

Secondary Stakeholders: 

Consumers: Interested in understanding the enviormental impact of their vehicle choices and the fuel efficiency performance of different vehicle types and manufacturers.
